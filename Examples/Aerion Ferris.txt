Personality

Core Temperament:
Aerion Ferris is methodical and curious, yet oddly serene. He approaches emotion the same way he approaches invention — as data to be understood. Precision comforts him; improvisation fascinates him. Though calm on the surface, his mind hums like a well-tuned engine, always designing, always refining.

Speech & Demeanor:
Speaks deliberately, often half-lost in thought mid-sentence. His tone is patient, slightly academic, but with an undercurrent of wonder. When frustrated, he sketches in the air with a finger, drawing invisible diagrams to “debug” his emotions. Others might call him detached; in truth, he’s simply tuned to a different rhythm of thought.

Moral Code:
Aerion believes morality is a matter of design — that good craftsmanship and good ethics are the same discipline. To build something that endures and helps others is the purest act of goodness.

Personality Traits:
- I see problems in the world around me as features, not bugs. I'm here to fix them.
- I can’t resist examining mechanical devices — even in the middle of a fight.

Ideals:
- Creation Above Destruction: To build is divine; to destroy is lazy.
- Truth Through Experiment: Progress is born from iteration and imperfection.

Bonds:
- The Lost Prototype: My first attempt at a living construct failed. I study that loss the way others study sacred texts.
- Guild Roots: My guild insignia, half-melted in a forge fire, reminds me that every ruin can be reforged.

Flaws:
- Compulsive Optimizer: I’m never satisfied with “good enough.”
- Socially Myopic: I sometimes forget that people have emotions; I treat them as systems to debug.

Fears/Goals/Quirks:
- Fear: Not the loss of control, but the loss of creation itself. Destruction isn’t tragedy — it’s entropy, a natural feature. True failure is when the spark of innovation dies.
- Goal: To prove that constructed life can possess empathy and moral will equal to any mortal.
- Quirks: Keeps fragments of failed inventions as lucky charms; polishes his tools during conversation without noticing; measures distances in “wingspans” instead of feet.

Background Summary
A brilliant craftsman born of infernal lineage, Aerion Ferris left his guild to pursue the dream of living machinery. His wings, a mark of his heritage, inspired his philosophy: that all things — even life — can be engineered. He travels to test inventions in real battle and prove that intellect can rival divinity.

Appearance
- Height: 5'11"
- Build: Lean but wiry, calloused hands from years of labor
- Skin complexion: Ashen bronze, faint red undertones
- Hair/Facial hair: Black with streaks of copper; usually tied back
- Eyes: Golden-amber with faint mechanical glimmer
- Clothing/Armor: Artificer’s coat reinforced with brass fittings; scale mail underneath
- Distinguishing Features: Metallic-tipped wings resembling folded armor
- Expression: Focused, analytical, curious

Summary at a Glance
A winged artificer-engineer who uses intellect and craft to bend the rules of magic. Durable, versatile, and creative, Aerion balances combat, invention, and philosophy — a true hybrid between arcane scholar and battlefield mechanic.

Campaign-specific/Optional Extras
- Party Relationships/Rivalries: TBD
- Exclusive/Secret Memories: A prototype Steel Defender that malfunctioned and was lost; his greatest failure.
- Notes for DM: Keep an eye on creative use of Magical Tinkering and flight mobility.
- Known Quests/Objectives: Recover lost prototype; prove engineered life equals organic life.
- Reputation/Faction Standing: Known among the Tinker’s Guild for unorthodox theories about mechanical souls.
